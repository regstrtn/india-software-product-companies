# List of product based software companies in India

This repository contains a crowdsourced list of all product based software companies in India. We also try to source other information, eg, how many employees they have, and which cities do these companies have a presence in. 
While we try to keep the information as accurate as possible, there could be inaccuracies. Please point them out and send a pull request to correct them if possible. 
While adding a new company, try to keep the table sorted by NumberOfEmployees (descending order). 

### Salary information 
Salary column denotes the *_lowest_* base salary that these companies offer for SDE1 position - stocks and bonus are not included. The reason for reporting the lowest base salary is because this list is primarily intended for students or people with <2 years of experience. These people will most likely be applying for SDE 1 position.
