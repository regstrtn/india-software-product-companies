# This is the list of European software companies that hire directly from India

Please use this list with caution. There are 2 extremes here: 
1. People who say you will save even less in Europe than you do in India, and 
2. People who want to work in Europe no matter the salary. 

My personal advice, if you are young, you shouldn't worry about the salary. If you are getting an opportunity to get international experience, you take it, even if you save 0 rupees for the first 1-2 years. In the long term, it will always pay off.
