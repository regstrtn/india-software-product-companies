# This is the list of European software companies that hire directly from India

Please use this list with caution. Don't just convert the salary into INR, take into account the living expenses & tax etc as well. 

At the same time, do not listen to people who tell you "Europe is no good, you can save more in India". These people are living examples of "angoor khatte hain". My personal advice, if you are young, you shouldn't worry about the salary. If you are getting international experience, you take it, even if you save 0 rupees for the first 1-2 years. In the long term, it pay off much, much more.
